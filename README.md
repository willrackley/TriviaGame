This is a Trivia game that uses JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. The application also incorporates the use of timers and doggy gifs. The theme of the game is "fun facts about Dogs".

## How It Works
* A user is presented with 10 true or false questions, one question at a time.

* The user has 15 seconds to answer each question.

* Once the user makes their guess, they are presented with the correct answer and a fun doggy gif.

* Once the user completes all 10 questions, they are shown their overall score and an option to repeat the game.
